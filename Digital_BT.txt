==============
Audio Chipset:
==============

TI Offers Digital Input Class-D with DSP:
	TAS5713 <- probably not
	TAS5753 <- this one isn't bad
	TAS5754 <- still a good choice
	TAS5782 <- this one is really nice
	nevermind, TI failed -> software is terrible, can't be used without eval module

therefore:
Analog Devices ADAU1701 CODEC + DSP
	4 analog outputs -> 2 can be used for headphone/debugging
						2 for TPA3128 input

	2 analog inputs -> stereo input from AUX
		-> are op amp buffers necessary for AUX jack -> ADAU1701 ADC?
	I2S from Digital Input (BC127) -> GPIO of ADAU1701

	Is it possible to internally MUX analog inputs and I2S Inputs?
	Are there enough GPIOs on the ADAU1701?
	What crystal to use for ADAU1701?

	-----------------------------------------
	I2S Master/Slave between BC127 & ADAU1701
	-----------------------------------------
	Master has to provide the clock
		- let ADAU1701 be the master
		- this is configurable in software, doesn't affect hardware design
		- run at 24 bits (BC127 works at 16 bits, will truncate) and 48KHz
			-> does this mean a ADAU1702 can be used?

	-----------
	SPI vs. I2C
	-----------

	------------------
	Safeload Registers
	------------------
	5x28-bit values can be safeloaded while audio is still being processeed
	1. Write address to safeload address register
	2. Write data to safeload data register
	
	Additionally, apart from filter value changing, can safeload change the
	audio source? Change system sampling rate?


	Voltage Regulator
		- DVDD regulator can be driven by VDRIVE
		- needs >90mW dissipation at collector, PNP with current gain > 100

	Master volume/tone controls handled by ADAU1701
		- is this possible? (yes)

	How to clock ADAU1701?

	Output filter design:
		- active or passive?
			- can passive filter be connected directly to power amplifier input?
		- what op amp?

TPA3128 -> upgrade of infamous TPA3116/3118, pin-to-pin compatible

AUX Jack Input:
	Opamp buffer + bias -> ADAU1701
	 	- need 2 channel op amp
	 	- what gain does this need?	
	 		- what is the input range of the ADAU1701 ADC?
	 		- what is the bias point of the ADC?
	 		- what is the input AC voltage? ( < 1.5V p-p for sure)
	 		- maximize gain without overloading ADC


=================
Bluetooth Module:
=================

BC127 breakout -> mini-fied stackable breakout that can be used for multiple projects
Needs to have board-to-board connector to connect with main boards
	- can be stacked
		i.e. rectangular pin headers, mezzanine + standoffs
	- can be mounted vertically -> kind of like PC expansion cards
	- needs clearance for components on the breakout

Intended to reduce cost of developing with BC127 -> a failed BC127 causes otherwise
functional boards to be wasted

Is this worth it? Upfront cost of parts + boards is extra to project + height of board

Requirements:
	- easy BC127 mounting
	- optional 50 ohm antenna connector (SMA?)
	- optional stereo op amp buffer output
	- programming port breakout (UART)
	- LED indicator


================
Microcontroller:
================

MSP430F5529 -> cheap dev board, big interface
ATMEGA32U4  -> USB interface, cheap dev board, are there enough pins?
	- yes

MCU must power switch the rest of the circuit:
	i.e. mute power amp
		 fully control power to DSP, BC127

Handles User Control Input -> controls DSP

Need to flash Arduino Bootloader onto MCU -> Break out ICSP/SPI port
Need to break out USB to outside of enclosure
	- main board -> mechanical mounting board using FFC
	- any better way of connecting? FFC isn't 50 ohm impedance controlled
	- signal integrity of USB needs to be evaluated

Does MCU have enough memory to store presets?


==============
User Controls:
==============

Power Switch -> SPDT? Maybe have ON-OFF-ON to allow for wall operation/charging switch
Bluetooth/AUX switch

AUX Input Jack

Rotary Encoders:
	Volume Rotary Encoder
	Volume LED Ring
	
	EQ/Tone Rotary Encoder
	Tone LED Ring (must have multiple colours)
	Mode Switch/Momentary Button for EQ/Tone Encoder -> allows for possible 3 band EQ implementation
		- can be integrated into the encoder -> encoder with built in switch (Bournes PEC09 series)
		- 2320F-S0015

Battery Level Indication

LED Rings:
	- 3535 NeoPixels w/integrated driver in a ring
	- need custom mounting board -> might as well make mounting board for all controls

Possible:
	- right angle mounted encoders/switches, allowing for USB to be exposed on panel, LED indicators
	  have separate mounting boards
	- mounting panel needs to be CNC milled/routed -> what material -> darker wood?
	- passive components on board (caps for encoders, NeoPixels, etc.)

Alternatively, capacitive touch PCB under wood panel
	- need a mechanical on-off switch
	- need mechanical jacks (power, aux, USB)
	- could be used for other projects -> universal
	- only needs 3-4 channels, LED indicators


======
Power:
======

12V Amp Power -> Boost regulator?
3-4 cell Li-Ion Pack
Li-Ion Pack Charger <- switching boost?
Battery gas gauge
Buck for 3V3 IC power -> up to 150mA drawn from ADAU1701/1401
Separate Board for power -> this can be reused for future projects! It's a full standalone power supply!

===========
Connectors:
===========

Avoid screw terminals where possible
Prefer locking plug & play connectors
JST PH connectors are good for interfaces but need smaller/wider connectors
Stacking connector needed for BC127 breakout <- if this is done
Thicker connectors needed for power/speaker output


==========
Enclosure:
==========

CNC Carved Wood
Epoxy filled LED indication holes -> this might be hard
Perforated sheet metal grilles to protect speakers -> portability
Threaded inserts in wood to make speaker mounting face plates removable

How to mount user controls to enclosure? It's gotta look good/be sturdy?
How to mount boards, battery pack?
How to break out USB jack for programming MCU from outside enclosure?

	- grille epoxied to wooden frame
	- wooden frame attached to main enclosure with magnets

Supply caps

TPA3128 (2x30W) can only deliver ~8W to a 8ohm load at 12V PVcc

===================================
Power Supply Functional Blocks/ICs:
===================================

~12V (+/- 2V) rail (class D power amp, analog supply)
3V3 rail (digital, low voltage analog supply)

Questions:
	- can Li-Ion/LiPo be run without balancing (but protected)?
	- is a 12V regulator needed? (the battery varies +/- 2V but the amplifiers don't really care)
	- what is the best system to protect/balance and charge the batteries
	- how to switch from battery power to wall power?
	- do we need a better wall adapter? (have 9V 2A supply)
	- how does bqSTUDIO & the toolchain for the TI BQ chips work?
	- is it feasible/necessary to develop entire AFE and BMS for 3 cell Li-Ion

Li-Ion battery pack:
	- 18650 Li-Ion cells
	- 3-4S Lithium Ion Polymer (LiPo) pack (easier to get in Canada)
	Possibilities:
		- 2S2P (i.e. 2 series, 2 parallel), 7.4V nominal, ~4400mAH (depends on cells)
		- 3S (i.e. 3 series), 11.1V nominal, ~2200mAH
		- 4S, 14.8V nominal, ~2200mAH
	- what are the benefits, drawbacks of each option? (specifically between the parallel pack vs. all series)
	- cell protection -> why? how? what chips?

LiPo Pack:
	- easier to get in Canada
	- how to balance charge?
		- Intersil has 3-4 cell charger IC in QFN (ugh)
		- Seiko S-8209A individual stackable protection/balance ICs

12V Boost Converter (or not, if there are enough Li-Ions)
Li-Ion Pack Charger
Battery gas gauge (maybe)
Adjustable buck converter for 3V3 (5V) IC power -> up to 150mA drawn from ADAU1701/1401
	- LM2736 -> 0.75A, SOT223-6 buck regulator
Power down delay
	- comparator
	- relay and switching FET
	- alternatively, FET that turns off MCU power -> delay only needs to apply to digital lines
	- shutdown delay enable pins of regulators/power switches

Possible Board Implementation:
	- BMS + Regulators
	- TI: companion AFE + Gas Gauge BMS
		- BQ76920 3-5 cell AFE
		- BQ78350 SMBUS Gas Gauge + BMS Controller
			- calculates charge voltage and current needs, but needs external charger
		- god bqSTUDIO is a fucking pain in the ass I hate TI
		- BQ40Z50-R2 -> Li-Ion Battery Pack Manager (this is standalone!!) but it's a 0.4mm QFN T^T
			- needs bqSTUDIO
		- BQ40Z60 -> older device, 0.5mm QFN
			- still needs bqSTUDIO

	- MAXIM Integrated - MAX17205 <- no leads, but specs look good
		- need protection IC and charging IC (better than TI's AFE + Gauge)
		- need to evaluate compatibility with protection IC (balancing resistors on MAX17205 may
		  interfere with protection circuit input)
		- need CHG DSG driver BQ76200

	- Intersil ISL94202
		- integrated and standalone balance + protection
		- very integrated and good functionality
		- CHG, DSG, PCHG FET drivers
		- I2C control (full duplex I2C wtf?) with simple registers
		- does not include gas gauge
		- 0.4mm QFN-44 <- hard to solder
		- $8.88 a chip is expensive

	Chargers:
		- BQ24610 (ok...9$)
		- BQ24600 (ok...9$)
		- MAX17435 (wtf!?!?!? 23$???)
		- ISL9238 (expensive!! 13$ T^T)		<- very integrated, strongest candidate, but no stock
		- BQ24617

Cell Protection Power FETs:
	- CSD18534
	- IRFH8311

Thermistors:
	- NTC, 10K thermistors: 1 on pack, 1 on PCB near power path FETs

	- NXFT15XH103FA2B050

Microcontroller Functionalities:
	- shutdown delay
	- LED power/charge indicator
	- charger enable
	- monitor load/adapter status, turn on/off:
		- charge controller
		- switching regulators
		- itself (low power mode, wait for interrupt?)

	- Pins:
	   -> ISL94202
		- SDA
		- SCL
		- INT (active low, uC fails to send a slave byte)
		- PSD (pack shutdown)
		- FETSOFF
		- SD (DFET turn off indicator)
